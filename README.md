## Analysis Top 100 Spotify Tracks of 2018
At the end of each year, Spotify compiles a playlist of the songs streamed most often over the course of that year. This year's playlist (Top Tracks of 2018) includes 100 songs. The question is: What do these top songs have in common? Why do people like them?

## Original Data Source: The audio features for each song were extracted using the Spotify Web API and the spotipy Python library. Credit goes to Spotify for calculating the audio feature values.
